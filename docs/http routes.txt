GET /health
    If servers are synced, this gives a 200 "OK".
    If no servers are synced, it gives a 502 ":("

GET /user/login/:user_address
    Displays a "Sign in With Ethereum" message to be signed by the address's private key.
    Once signed, continue to `POST /user/login`

GET /user/login/:user_address/:message_eip
    Similar to `GET /user/login/:user_address` but gives the message in different formats depending on the eip.
    Wallets have varying support. This shouldn't be needed by most users.
    The message_eip should be hidden behind a small gear icon near the login button.
    Once signed, continue to `POST /user/login`

    Supported:
        EIP191 as bytes
        EIP191 as a hash
        EIP4361 (the default)

    Support coming soon:
        EIP1271 for contract signing

POST /user/login?invite_code=SOMETHING_SECRET
    Verifies the user's signed message.

    The post should have JSON data containing "sig" (the signature) and "msg" (the original message).

    Optionally requires an invite_code.
    The invite code is only needed for new users. Once registered, it is not necessary.

    If the invite code and signature are valid, this returns JSON data containing "rpc_keys", "bearer_token" and the "user".

    "rpc_keys" contains the key and settings for all of the user's keys.
    If the user is new, an "rpc_key" will be created for them.

    The "bearer_token" is required by some endpoints. Include it in the "AUTHORIZATION" header in this format: "bearer :bearer_token".
    The token is good for 4 weeks and the 4 week time will reset whenever the token is used.

    The "user" just has an address at first, but you can prompt them to add an email address. See `POST /user`

GET /user
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, display's the user's data as JSON.



POST /user
    POST the data in the same format that `GET /user` gives it.
    If you do not want to update a field, do not include it in the POSTed JSON.
    If you want to delete a field, include the data's key and set the value to an empty string.

    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, updates the user's data and returns the updated data as JSON.

GET /user/balance
    Not yet implemented.

    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, displays data about the user's balance and payments as JSON.

POST /user/balance/:txid
    Not yet implemented. Rate limited by IP.

    Checks the ":txid" for a transaction that updates a user's balance.
    The backend will be watching for these transactions, so this should not be needed in the common case.
    However, log susbcriptions are not perfect and so it might sometimes be needed.

GET /user/keys
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, displays data about the user's keys as JSON.

POST or PUT /user/keys
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, allows the user to create a new key or  change options on their keys.

    The POSTed JSON can have these fields:
        key_id: Option<u64>,
        description: Option<String>,
        private_txs: Option<bool>,
        active: Option<bool>,
        allowed_ips: Option<String>,
        allowed_origins: Option<String>,
        allowed_referers: Option<String>,
        allowed_user_agents: Option<String>,

    The PUTed JSON has the same fields as the POSTed JSON, except for there is no `key_id`

    If you do not want to update a field, do not include it in the POSTed JSON.
    If you want to delete a string field, include the data's key and set the value to an empty string.

    `allowed_ips`, `allowed_origins`, `allowed_referers`, and `allowed_user_agents` can have multiple values by separating them with commas.
    `allowed_ips` must be in CIDR Notation (ex: "10.1.1.0/24" for a network, "10.1.1.10/32" for a single address).
    The spec technically allows for bytes in `allowed_origins` or `allowed_referers`, but our code currently only supports strings. If a customer needs bytes, then we can code support for them.

    `private_txs` are not currently recommended. If high gas is not supplied then they will likely never be included. Improvements to this are in the works

    Soon, the POST data will also have a `log_revert_trace: Option<f32>`. This will by the percent chance to log any calls that "revert" to the database. Large dapps probably want this to be a small percent, but development keys will probably want 100%. This will not be enabled until automatic pruning is coded.

GET `/user/revert_logs`
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, fetches paginated revert logs for the user.
    More documentation will be written here once revert logging is enabled.

GET /user/stats/aggregate
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, fetches paginated aggregated stats for the user.
    Pages are limited to 200 entries. The backend config can change this page size if necessary.
    Can be filtered by:
        `chain_id` - set to 0 for all. 0 is the default.
        `query_start` - The start date in unix epoch time.
        `query_window_seconds` - How many seconds to aggregate the stats over.
        `page` - The page to request. Defaults to 0.

GET /user/stats/detailed
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, fetches paginated stats for the user with more detail. The request method is included. For user privacy, we intentionally do not include the request's calldata.
    Can be filtered the same as `GET /user/stats/aggregate`
    Soon will also be filterable by "method"

POST /user/logout
    Checks the "AUTHORIZATION" header for a valid bearer token.
    If valid, deletes the bearer token from the proxy.
    The user will need to `POST /user/login` to get a new bearer token.
